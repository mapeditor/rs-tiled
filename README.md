Read maps from the [Tiled Map Editor](http://www.mapeditor.org/) into rust for use in video games. It is game engine agnostic and pretty barebones at the moment. Documentation is available [on docs.rs](https://docs.rs/tiled/).

Code contributions are welcome as are bug reports, documentation, suggestions and criticism.

[There is a package on crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/tiled), to use simply add:

```
tiled = "0.9.5"
```

to the dependencies section of your Cargo.toml.

### Example

```rust
use tiled::map::Map;

fn main() {
    let map = Map::parse_file("assets/tiled_base64_zlib.tmx").unwrap();
    println!("{:?}", map);
    println!("{:?}", map.tileset_by_gid(22));
}
```
